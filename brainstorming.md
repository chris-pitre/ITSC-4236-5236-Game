# Game Ideas
## Stealth Game
- Game similar to Metal Gear/Metal Gear Solid Games
- Player sneaks around trying to achieve some sort of goal
### AI Component
- Enemies have patrol patterns that they follow
- Have some sort of cone of vision that if the player is detected in it, it would disrupt their patrol pattern and they would chase
- The player can get caught and it can result in a game over
- If the player is skilled enough, they can escape the enemy's range of agro or something and they would leave caution mode
