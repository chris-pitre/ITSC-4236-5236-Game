# Game Name Idea
 - call of duty mafia
## Stealth Game
- Game similar to Metal Gear/Metal Gear Solid Games
- Player sneaks around trying to achieve some sort of goal
### AI Component
- Enemies have patrol patterns that they follow
- Have some sort of cone of vision that if the player is detected in it, it would disrupt their patrol pattern and they would chase
- The player can get caught and it can result in a game over
- If the player is skilled enough, they can escape the enemy's range of agro or something and they would leave caution mode
- Other patrols can be warned while in caution mode and bring other enemies toward the player
- Sounds can be detected by henchmen and dogs if in proximity
- Sound level detection from 1 to 3
### Enemy types
- (cameras) pan areas that alert guards if the player is detected
- (cameras with guns) will shoot on sight 
- (roaming dogs) that have heightened hearing and smell and are 2x faster than normal enemy
- (henchmen/goons) normal NPC enemies that roam
  - has the possibility to drop stems for health, and 1911 handgun and ammo
- (Managers) These people hold key cards to the next floor and are a little tougher than henchmen, they have 1.5x more health and do 1.5x more damage
  - possible to drop a silenced pistol and ammo
- (Vice President) second to last boss (only 2 main bosses) first boss you encounter difficult (****)
- (President/CEO Boss) last boss to encounter extremely difficult (*****)
### Items
